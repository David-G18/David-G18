### :shipit: About Me :
I'm a back-end developer from Bogotá, Colombia, I've always been a technology enthusiast and when discovered the world of web programming was       fascinated by every new thing I learned.  
In April 2022 I wanted to make a change in my life, I left the university to enter the world of web development, at that time I found the Bootcamp ***SoyHenry*** where I learned many valuable things and I've met amazing people.  
I want to be able to show the world what I'm capable of doing :fire:.

- :computer: I'm currently working on several projects with Node.js and React.js to improve and expand my knowledge
- :seedling: Learning everything related to Python and other JavaScript libraries like React Native
- :e-mail: Contact me via e-mail kdavidg1998@gmail.com
- :zap: Curious fact: I know how to play several instruments, including the guitar, and I've always been lazy to change the tuning of the guitar, so someday I'll have several guitars with different tunings, so I don't have to change the tuning of a guitar, instead, I just change guitars and that's it :guitar:

### :shipit: About Me :
I'm a back-end developer from Bogotá, Colombia, I've always been a technology enthusiast and when discovered the world of web programming was       fascinated by every new thing I learned. In April 2022 I wanted to make a change in my life, left the university to enter the world of web development, at that time I found the Bootcamp *SoyHenry* <a href = "https://www.soyhenry.com/webfullstack"> <img src = "https://assets.soyhenry.com/icons/favicon-32x32.png" alt="Soy Henry Badge"/> </a> where I learned many valuable things and I've met amazing people.

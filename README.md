### :shipit: About Me :
I'm a back-end developer from Bogotá, Colombia, I've always been a technology enthusiast and when discovered the world of web programming was       fascinated by every new thing I learned.  
In April 2022 I wanted to make a change in my life, I left the university to enter the world of web development, at that time I found the Bootcamp ***SoyHenry*** where I learned many valuable things and I've met amazing people.  
I want to be able to show the world what I'm capable of doing :fire:.

- :computer: I'm currently working on several projects with Node.js and React.js to improve and expand my knowledge.
- :seedling: Learning everything related to Python and other JavaScript libraries like React Native.
